# A Coder Across The Multiverse

## Project Description
First bootcamp group project at <Academia de Código_> after 3 weeks of learning Java.
We were challenged to develop a game applying the technologies we had learned with a deadline of 10 nights, as the classes proceeded during daytime.

## The Idea
Our project was inspired by Harry Potter’s Triwizard Maze. The main character is a developer that makes a fatal error, and ends up being pulled into the pop culture multiverse, having to fight his way out.
Helped by a mentor, the character goes through several mazes and is occasionally faced with random challenges related to pop culture trivia.

## Development
We worked in a remote environment, SCRUMing, GITing and pair-programming our way into a solid workflow. 

## Paradigm
OOP

## Technologies
Java 7, SimpleGFX Library, IntelliJ IDEA, Apache Ant, Git, Photoshop
